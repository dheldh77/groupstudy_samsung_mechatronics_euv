### What is Java Persistence API (JPA)?
Let's first define [persistence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)).
> The characteristic of the state of a system that outlives (persists more than) the process that created it. 

Data is typi cally persisted by storing them in databases. So the JPA is a java specification that provides basic rules for implementing object-relational mapping (ORM). That means that JPA doesn't do any of the work. Instead, ORM tools like Hibernate implement the JPA specifications. 

### Why use ORM?
You can increase the development speed by avoiding repetitive code, such as the code responsible for mapping objects to the database. There are also fewer chances of error by not having to handle raw queries. And by only dealing with java objects, you can still use OOP-style programming without having to worry about mapping each to the DB.

### Using Spring Data JPA
Spring Data JPA is another abstraction layer that is meant to facilitate the use of JPA, more specifically the JPA provider like Hibernate. So Spring Data JPA is not a JPA provider.

### Annotations
#### @Entity
Defines an entity class, which is basically a domain object that represents a table in a database. Instances of this class represent rows of the table. Each will be differentiated by an id. 

The name of the entity defaults to the class name, but it can be set differently through `@Entity(name="EntityName")`.

#### @Id
Specifies the field as PK (primary key).

#### @GeneratedValue
Specifies the PK generation strategy. If you want to use the auto-increment option, you must set the strategy as:  
`@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)`

#### @Column
All the fields of the class become a column by default. But you can use this to set different options other than the default values. For instance, the name will default to the field name, and to a length of 255 (for string columns only).


### Defining an Entity Class
As mentioned above, an entity class represents a table in the DB. 
Let's look at an example.
```java
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor
@Entity // defines an entity class -> represents DB table
public class Posts {

    @Id // specifies PK field
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) // specifies rule for PK generation. IDENTITY -> auto increment option
    private Long id;

    @Column(length = 500, nullable = false)
    private String title;

    @Column(columnDefinition = "TEXT", nullable = false)
    private String content;

    // uses default column settings if not specified
    private String author;

    @Builder
    public Posts(String title, String content, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.content = content;
        this.author = author;
    }
```

### Creating a Repository
We can create a repository by creating an interface that extends `JpaRepository`. This will give us basic CRUD operations for our entity class to our DB. 

We can achieve the same using the `CrudRepository` interface. But notice that `JpaRepository` extends `PagingAndSortingRepository`, which extends `CrudRepository`. So if you only want CRUD operations, you may use `CrudRepository` instead. 

The annotation @Repository isn't required if we use the method mentioned above. This is only needed if we want to create custom DAOs (Data Access Objects)[^1]. 

```java
public interface PostsRepository extends JpaRepository<Posts, Long> {
    // JpaRepository<EntityClass, PK type> -> Generates basic CRUD methods
}
```

We can then insert into the table, or retrieve from it.
```java
@Test
public void saveAndGetPosts() {
    String title = "Test post";
    String content = "Test content";

    // Create Posts entity instance through builder pattern (using lombok @Builder)
    // save() -> inserts/updates to table
    postsRepository.save(Posts.builder()
            .title(title)
            .content(content)
            .author("author@email.com")
            .build());

    // returns all rows of table (or instances of type)
    List<Posts> postList = postsRepository.findAll();

    Posts posts = postList.get(0);
    assertThat(posts.getTitle()).isEqualTo(title);
    assertThat(posts.getContent()).isEqualTo(content);
}
```

[^1]: What's the difference between a repository and a DAO? They're similar in their objective, to access data from the DB. But a repository acts like a collection and is closer to the domain, meaning that it is a DAO but limited to a single type (or single table). Check out this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8550124/what-is-the-difference-between-dao-and-repository-patterns) for more info.
